# Number_guessing_game_AI
I used Vibe coding for the first time, and I used Claude to write a website for me. 
I asked Claude to create a UI and convert the algorithm I wrote in python a long time ago for a number guessing game(its not the normal 1-100 one, its much harder)
If you want to see the code and the game: https://github.com/adrianyang2012/Number_guessing_game
